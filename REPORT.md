REPORT

This is a short report on my Superpy project.  It involves an explanation of which modules i have used and some examples of my code i have written.

Pandas (python library)

It was hard to find the write way to easily read external files (csv) and display them in the command- line - interface, storing and writing data to my csv file again, like in transactions.csv. So at last i used Pandas.
